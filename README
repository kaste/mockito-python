  import unittest
  from mockito import *
  
  class DemoTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def testStubbing(self):
      # create a mock
      mock = Mock()
  
      # stub it
      when(mock).getStuff("cool").thenReturn("cool stuff")
      
      # use the mock
      self.assertEqual("cool stuff", mock.getStuff("cool"))
      
      # what happens when you pass different argument?
      self.assertEqual(None, mock.getStuff("different argument"))
      
    def testVerification(self):
      # create a mock
      mock = Mock()
  
      # use the mock
      mock.doStuff("cool")
      
      # verify the interactions. Method and parameters must match. Otherwise verification error.
      verify(mock).doStuff("cool")
