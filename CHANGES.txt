MOCKITO CHANGE LOG
==================

Release 1.0.0 (yet to come)
---------------------------

This is a major update; mostly because of internal code reorganization (`imports`) it cannot be guaranteed that this will not break for you. Though if you just used the public API you should be fine. None of the vintage old tests have been removed and they at least pass.

In general unclassified imports (``from mocktio import *``) are not recommended. But if you did, we do not export ``Mock`` anymore. ``Mock`` has been deprecated long ago and is now for internal use only. You must use ``mock``.

Another important change is, that `mockito`s strict mode is far more strict than before. We now generally try to match the signature of the target method
with your usage. Usually this should help you find bugs in your code, because
it will make it easier to spot changing interfaces.

- ``mock``, ``when``, ``verify`` return mostly empty objects. It is unlikely to have a method_name clash.

- Specced mocks ``instance = mock(Class)`` will pass isinstance tests like ``isinstance(instance, Class)``

- For ``when`` and ``verify`` the function signature or argument matchers can be greatly simplified. E.g. ``when(requests).get(...).thenReturn('OK')`` will match any argument you pass in. There are ``args`` and ``kwargs`` matchers as well. So ``when(requests).get('https://...', **kwargs).thenReturn(...)`` will make a exact match on the first argument, the url, and ignore all the headers and other stuff.

- Mocks can be preconfigured: ``mock({'text': 'OK'})``. For specced mocks this would be e.g. ``mock({'text': 'OK'}, spec=requests.Response)``.

- If you mock or patch an object, the function signatures will be matched. So::

    def foo(a, b=1): ...

    when(main).foo(12)  # will pass
    when(main).foo(c=13)  # will raise immediately

- Mock Dummies are now callable: ``m = mock(); m(1, 2); verify(m).__call__(...)``

- ``Mock()`` is now an implementation detail; it is not exported anymore. Use ``mock()``.

- You unstub individual patched objects ``unstub(obj)``. (Before it was all or nothing.)

- Added basic context manager support when using ``when``. Note that ``verify`` has to be called within the with context.

    with when(rex).waggle().thenReturn('Yup'):
        assert rex.waggle() == 'Yup'
        verify(rex).waggle()



Release 0.7.1 (December 27, 2016)
---------------------------------

- Fix: Allow verifyNoMoreInteractions call for real (stubbed) objects


Release 0.7.0 (July 15, 2016)
-----------------------------

- Added a ton of new argument matchers. Namely::

    'and_', 'or_', 'not_', 'eq', 'neq', 'lt', 'lte', 'gt', 'gte',
    'arg_that', 'matches', 'captor'

- Aliases 'any' matcher to 'any_' because it's a builtin.
- Fixes an issue where mockito could not correctly verify your function invocations, if you grabbed a method from its object and used it ('detached') as a plain function::

    m = mock()
    f = m.foo  # detach
    f(1, 2)    # pass it around and use it like a function
    f(2, 3)
    verify(m).foo(...) # finally verify interactions

Thank you @maximkulkin


Release 0.6.1 (May 20, 2016)
----------------------------

- Added ``thenAnswer(callable)``. The callable will be called to compute the answer the stubbed method will return. For that it will receive the arguments of the caller::

    m = mock()
    when(m).do_times(any(), any()).thenAnswer(lambda one, two: one * two)
    self.assertEquals(20, m.do_times(5, 4))

Thank you @stubbsd

Release 0.6.0 (April 25, 2016)
------------------------------

- Print keyword arguments nicely.
- Be very forgiving about return values and assume None as default. T.i. ``when(Dog).bark('Miau').thenReturn()`` is enough to return None.
- Make keyword argument order unimportant.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Throw early when calling not expected methods in strict mode.
