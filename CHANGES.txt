MOCKITO CHANGE LOG
==================

Release 0.6.1 (May 20, 2016)
----------------------------

- Added ``thenAnswer(callable)``. The callable will be called to compute the answer the stubbed method will return. For that it will receive the arguments of the caller::

    m = mock()
    when(m).do_times(any(), any()).thenAnswer(lambda one, two: one * two)
    self.assertEquals(20, m.do_times(5, 4))


Release 0.6.0 (April 25, 2016)
------------------------------

- Print keyword arguments nicely.
- Be very forgiving about return values and assume None as default. T.i. ``when(Dog).bark('Miau').thenReturn()`` is enough to return None.
- Make keyword argument order unimportant.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Throw early when calling not expected methods in strict mode.
