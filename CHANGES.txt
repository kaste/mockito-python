MOCKITO CHANGE LOG
==================

Next
----

- Code base now is python 3 compatible. No 2to3 anymore.
- Fine tune error messages on unexpected calls or verifications. E.g. if you expect ``when(dog).bark('Wuff')`` but on call time do ``dog.bark('Wufff')``. Likewise, if you call ``dog.bark('Miau')`` and then ``verify(dog).bark('Maui')``.
- @felixonmars fixed a small compatibility issue with python 3.8
    

Release 1.1.1 (August 28, 2018)
-------------------------------

- Fix: The context manager (``with``) has now a proper implementation
- Fix: Calling ``patch`` with two arguments can now be used with ``with``
- Fix: Do not treat the placeholder arguments (Ellipsis, args, kwargs) as special on call time anymore. (T.i. they only have a meaning when stubbing or verifying.)
- Enhancement: Changed some truthy or equality tests to identity (``is``) tests. This reduces edge-cases where some user object defines ``__eq__`` or ``__bool__``. (Hello _numpy_!)


Release 1.1.0 (May 2, 2018)
---------------------------

- Added ``forget_invocations`` function. Thanks to @maximkulkin

This is generally useful if you already call mocks during your setup routine.
Now you could call ``forget_invocations`` at the end of your setup, and 
have a clean 'recording' for your actual test code. T.i. you don't have
to count the invocations from your setup code anymore.


Release 1.0.12 (June 3, 2017)
-----------------------------

- Better error messages for failed verifications. By @lwoydziak


Release 1.0.7 - 1.0.10 (January 31 - February 2, 2017)
------------------------------------------------------

- ``verifyZeroInteractions`` implemented. This is actually a *breaking change*, because ``verifyZeroInteractions`` was an alias for ``verifyNoMoreInteractions`` (sic!). If you used it, just call the other function.

- ``verifyStubbedInvocationsAreUsed`` implemented. This is meant to be called right before an ``unstub`` and should improve long time maintenance. It doesn't help during design time. Note that `pytest-mockito` automatically calls this for you.

- All `verify*` functions now warn you if you pass in an object which was never stubbed.


Release 1.0.0 - 1.0.5 (January 24 - 27, 2017)
---------------------------------------------

This is a major update; mostly because of internal code reorganization (`imports`) it cannot be guaranteed that this will not break for you. Though if you just used the public API you should be fine. None of the vintage old tests have been removed and they at least pass.

In general unclassified imports (``from mocktio import *``) are not recommended. But if you did, we do not export `Mock` anymore. `Mock` has been deprecated long ago and is now for internal use only. You must use `mock`.

Another important change is, that *mockito*'s strict mode is far more strict than before. We now generally try to match the signature of the target method
with your usage. Usually this should help you find bugs in your code, because
it will make it easier to spot changing interfaces.

- ``mock``, ``when``, ``verify`` return mostly empty objects. It is unlikely to have a method_name clash.

- Specced mocks ``instance = mock(Class)`` will pass isinstance tests like ``isinstance(instance, Class)``

- For ``when`` and ``verify`` the function signature or argument matchers can be greatly simplified. E.g. ``when(requests).get(...).thenReturn('OK')`` will match any argument you pass in. There are ``args`` and ``kwargs`` matchers as well. So ``when(requests).get('https://...', **kwargs).thenReturn(...)`` will make an exact match on the first argument, the url, and ignore all the headers and other stuff.

- Mocks can be preconfigured: ``mock({'text': 'OK'})``. For specced mocks this would be e.g. ``mock({'text': 'OK'}, spec=requests.Response)``.

- If you mock or patch an object, the function signatures will be matched. So::

    def foo(a, b=1): ...

    when(main).foo(12)  # will pass
    when(main).foo(c=13)  # will raise immediately

- Mock Dummies are now callable::

    m = mock()
    m(1, 2)
    verify(m).__call__(...)

- ``Mock()`` is now an implementation detail; it is **not** exported anymore. Use ``mock()``.

- You can unstub individual patched objects ``unstub(obj)``. (Before it was all or nothing.)

- Added basic context manager support when using ``when``. Note that ``verify`` has to be called within the with context.

::

    with when(rex).waggle().thenReturn('Yup'):
        assert rex.waggle() == 'Yup'
        verify(rex).waggle()

- Aliased ``any_`` to ``ANY``, ``args`` to ``ARGS`` and ``kwargs`` to ``KWARGS``. You can use python's builtin ``any`` as a stand in for ``ANY``.

- As a convenience you can use our ``any_`` matcher like a type instead of ``any_()``::

    dummy(1)
    verify(dummy).__call__(ANY)

- Added ``when2``, ``expect``, ``spy2``

- Make the mocked function (replacement) more inspectable. Copy `__doc__`, `__name__` etc.

- You can configure magic methods on mocks::

    dummy = mock()
    when(dummy).__getitem__(1).thenReturn(2)
    assert dummy[1] == 2



Release 0.7.1 (December 27, 2016)
---------------------------------

- Fix: Allow ``verifyNoMoreInteractions`` call for real (stubbed) objects


Release 0.7.0 (July 15, 2016)
-----------------------------

- Added a ton of new argument matchers. Namely::

    'and_', 'or_', 'not_', 'eq', 'neq', 'lt', 'lte', 'gt', 'gte',
    'arg_that', 'matches', 'captor'

- Aliases ``any`` matcher to ``any_`` because it's a builtin.
- Fixes an issue where mockito could not correctly verify your function invocations, if you grabbed a method from its object and used it ('detached') as a plain function::

    m = mock()
    f = m.foo  # detach
    f(1, 2)    # pass it around and use it like a function
    f(2, 3)
    verify(m).foo(...) # finally verify interactions

Thank you @maximkulkin


Release 0.6.1 (May 20, 2016)
----------------------------

- Added ``thenAnswer(callable)``. The callable will be called to compute the answer the stubbed method will return. For that it will receive the arguments of the caller::

    m = mock()
    when(m).do_times(any(), any()).thenAnswer(lambda one, two: one * two)
    self.assertEquals(20, m.do_times(5, 4))

Thank you @stubbsd

Release 0.6.0 (April 25, 2016)
------------------------------

- Print keyword arguments nicely.
- Be very forgiving about return values and assume None as default. T.i. ``when(Dog).bark('Miau').thenReturn()`` is enough to return None.
- Make keyword argument order unimportant.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Throw early when calling not expected methods in strict mode.
